# res2dinv_tools

This repository contains Matlab scripts that help working with the different types of in- and output data files of the Res2dinv geophysical modeling and inversion sofware family (www.geotomosoft.com).

## Scripts

`inv2mod.m` converts the .INV file obtained from Res2dinv into a .MOD file for Res2dmod.

`read_inv.m` reads the .INV file containing Res2Dinv inversion results.
